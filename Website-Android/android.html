            <h1>Android logo history</h1>

            <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most widely used for mobile devices around the world. But perhaps you don't know the history behind your friendly mascot and its curious name. Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>

            <h2>The first version</h2>
            <p>The first attempt to create a mascot appeared in 2007 and came from a developer named <a class="extern" href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" rel="external">Dan Morrill</a>. He mentioned that he opened <a class="extern" href="https://inkscape.org" target="_blank" rel="external">Inkscape</a> (free software for image vectorization) and created his own version of the robot. The objective was simply to personify the system for his team; there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>The first peculiar version was named the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>
        
            <h2>A new mascot appears</h2>

            <p>The idea of having a mascot matured, and the mission was passed on to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a class="extern" href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="_blank" rel="external">Irina Blok</a>, who was also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

                <img src="images/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina Blok, creator of Bugdroid">
            </picture>

            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also facilitate quick identification for those who look at it. Thus, <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, Android's new mascot, was born.</p>

            <img src="images/bugdroid.png" class="small" alt="Bugdroid">

            <p>The main inspiration for the features of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from the dolls illustrating bathroom doors, indicating the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was at her desk in the <strong>Google</strong> office, glanced towards the bathrooms, and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, and objective.</p>

                <p>Another interesting aspect of Android is that each version has always been named after a sweet, following alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                    <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                    <li>3.0 -  Eclair</li>
                    <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                    <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                    <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                    <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
                    <li>4.4 - KitKat</li>
                    <li>5.0 - Lolipop</li>
                    <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                    <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
                    <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                    <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> does not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbering, giving rise to Android 10.</p>
